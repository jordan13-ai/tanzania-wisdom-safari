        overview: "The Marangu Route, nicknamed the 'Coca-Cola Route' due to the availability of soft drinks at the huts, is the oldest and most established route on Kilimanjaro. It's the only route offering hut accommodation instead of camping, making it popular with those who prefer sleeping in beds. However, the 5-day itinerary has a lower success rate due to less acclimatization time. We strongly recommend the 6-day option.",

                answer: "The rapid ascent (1,600m to 3,960m in just two days) doesn't allow proper acclimatization. Many climbers experience severe altitude sickness and must turn back. The 60% success rate is significantly lower than other routes."

                answer: "The route itself is not technically dangerous - no climbing equipment needed. However, the rapid ascent increases altitude sickness risk, which can be serious if ignored. Our guides are trained to recognize symptoms and will make the call to descend if necessary."
