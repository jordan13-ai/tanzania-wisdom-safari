        question: "Do I need prior climbing experience?",
        answer: "No technical climbing skills are required. Kilimanjaro is a trek, not a technical climb. However, you should be in good physical condition and comfortable hiking for 5-8 hours per day."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the success rate?",
        answer: "Success rates vary by route and duration. Longer routes (7-9 days) have success rates of 85-98%, while shorter routes (5-6 days) average 60-75%. Tanzania Wisdom Safaris maintains above-average success rates through proper acclimatization protocols."
    },
    {
        question: "When is the best time to climb?",
        answer: "The best months are January-March and June-October. These periods offer the driest weather and clearest views. December and April-May are wetter but less crowded."
    },
    {
        question: "How cold does it get?",
        answer: "Temperatures range from 25°C (77°F) in the rainforest to -20°C (-4°F) at the summit. Proper layering and quality gear are essential."
    },
    {
        question: "What about altitude sickness?",
        answer: "Altitude sickness is a risk above 3,000m. We mitigate this through gradual ascent, 'climb high, sleep low' strategies, daily health checks, and experienced guides trained in altitude illness recognition."
    },
    {
        question: "How fit do I need to be?",
        answer: "You should be able to hike 5-8 hours per day carrying a light daypack. We recommend 3-6 months of cardiovascular training including hiking, running, cycling, and stair climbing."
    },
    {
        question: "What is included in the price?",

    },

        question: "Can I charge my devices?",

                                    Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa and the tallest free-standing mountain in the world, rising 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above sea level. Located in northeastern Tanzania near the Kenyan border, this dormant stratovolcano is one of the Seven Summits and attracts over 50,000 climbers annually.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What makes Kilimanjaro truly unique is that it requires no technical climbing skills - it's a challenging trek accessible to anyone with determination and proper preparation. The mountain features three volcanic cones: Kibo (the highest), Mawenzi, and Shira.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Climbers journey through five distinct ecological zones: cultivated farmland, lush rainforest, heath and moorland, alpine desert, and finally the arctic summit zone with its glaciers and ice fields. This incredible diversity in just a few days of trekking is unmatched anywhere on Earth.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For the Chagga people who live on Kilimanjaro's slopes, the mountain is sacred. Its name likely derives from the Swahili words "Kilima" (mountain) and "Njaro" (whiteness), referring to its snow-capped peak - though sadly, climate change is causing these glaciers to recede.

                                    <strong>April-May</strong> and <strong>November</strong> are the wettest months with afternoon rains. Routes are less crowded and prices may be lower, but success rates decrease due to weather. The Rongai Route (northern approach) is drier during these months.

                            Tipping is customary and expected in Tanzania. Your crew works incredibly hard to ensure your success and safety. Recommended amounts: $250-300 for guides, $150-200 for assistant guides, $100-150 for cook, and $50-75 per porter. We provide detailed tipping guidelines during your pre-climb briefing.
